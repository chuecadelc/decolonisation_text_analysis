# Text Analysis on Sociology lecture content
The data was collected by Maryanne Ko and Stephen Ashe from the Deconolinsation Group in the Sociology department at Durham University. 

I have cleaned cleaned and processed the co for text analysis to extract themes, theories, and concepts discussed across 11 modules of 20 lectures each. Using topic modelling (LDA and NMF) I created treemap visualisations of core themes, theories and concepts across modules to show the diversity of content. 
I have also created word clouds of theories and concepts covered in those modules to highlight the most prominent one- and two-words. 
There is also an interactive map of countries mentioned across modules to explore the global focus of lectures in the department. 
Additional visualisations include the frequency of mentions of racism, colonialism, imperialism across modules.
