# Text Analysis on Sociology lecture content
The data was collected by Maryanne Ko and Stephen Ashe from the Deconolinsation Group in the Sociology department at Durham University. I have cleaned and processed it for text analysis to extract themes, theories, and concepts discussed across 11 modules of 20 lectures each.
Using topic modelling (LDA and NMF) I created treemap visualisations of core themes, theories and concepts across modules to show the diversity of content. I have also created wordclouds of theories and concepts covered in those modules to highlight the most promitent one- and two-words.
There is also an interactive map of countries mentioned across modules to explore the global focus of lectures in the department. Additional visualisations include the frequency of mentions of racism, coloniamism, imperialism across modules. 
These outputs have been used in the curriculum mapping exercise report (to be) presented at the Education Away Day (15th Sep 2025) contributing to the equality and diversity of the academic curriculum.
